# React + Vite

- Employee Registration Application CRUD - Create Read Update Delete
- This is a simple employee registration application using React and Vite.
- I have created an Employee Component where  you can add, read, update and delete employee details.
- I have a Navbar  component for navigation

- It allows users to create, read, update, and delete employee records.
- I've style my application using css
- Employees can add their name and surname, phone number, email address, upload a profile picture, and select which job position they  have.
- I've used  the useState hook to store the employee data in the state of the application.
- I've added a handleDelete  function to delete an employee record.
- I've added a handleUpdate function to update an employee record.
- I've added a handleAdd function to add a new employee record.
- I've added a handleChange  function to handle changes to the employee data.
- I've added a JSON server to store employee details

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
